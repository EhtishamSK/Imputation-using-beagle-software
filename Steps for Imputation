Imputation of Missing Data Using Beagle Software

Prerequisites
•	Beagle Software: Download here
•	VCF File: Ensure your input file is in VCF format. If starting with a HapMap file, conversion to VCF format is necessary (steps included).

Steps for Imputation
1.	Download the Beagle software from the official website.
2.	Use TASSEL software to convert hapmap into VCF format. The conversion process in TASSEL is straightforward and can be done via the graphical interface. 
3.	Place the downloaded Beagle software file in the same directory as your input VCF file. Ensure both files are in the desired working directory.
4.	Open the command prompt (cmd). Change the working directory to the folder containing the Beagle software and the VCF file input. command to change directory: cd C:\Users\Ehtisham\Documents\Beagle
5.	Run the following command to start the imputation process: java -jar exact.name.of.beagle.software.file nthreads=2 gt=Genotypic_file.vcf out=Genotypic_file_imputed.vcf
6.	Replace exact.name.of.beagle.software.file with the name of the downloaded Beagle .jar file. Replace Genotypic_file.vcf with the name of your input VCF file.
7.	The output file (Genotypic_file_imputed.vcf) will be saved in the same directory.

After imputation is complete, use TASSEL software to convert the imputed VCF file back to HapMap format for downstream analyses such as GWAS.
