This repository provides a step-by-step guide for imputing missing data using Beagle software. Starting with a HapMap file, the process includes converting it to VCF format using TASSEL, organizing files in the working directory, and running Beagle via the command line to generate imputed VCF file. The imputed VCF can then be converted back to HapMap format for downstream analyses like GWAS.
